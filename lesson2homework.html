        	<b>Nearly three years after cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was shot and killed on the New Mexico set of the film Rust, Alec Baldwin is going on trial over her death.

           Here are the essential things to know
       </p>
       <b>What charge does Alec Baldwin face?
            </b>
       <p> 
       	   The actor is about to enter a New Mexico courtroom for the first time since the October 21, 2021 shooting. He is charged with felony involuntary manslaughter. If a jury unanimously convicts him, he could get 18 months in prison.
       </p>
       <p> 
		Baldwin, the star and co-producer of the Western, was pointing a revolver at Hutchins during a rehearsal in a small church on the movie set at Bonanza Creek Ranch when the gun went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has said he pulled back the hammer — but not the trigger — and the gun fired.

       <p> 
		Two major themes will predominate, one large, one small: the chaotic atmosphere of the movie set, and the details of the Italian-made classic revolver that Baldwin pointed at Hutchins.
       </p>
       <p> 
		It has never been officially determined who brought the live rounds that killed Hutchins on to the set. Prosecutors at the previous trial of Rust armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed alleged that she was responsible. She was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to the same 18 months in prison Baldwin faces.
