       <p> 
       	   Neighbours and emergency services rushed to the home – where the man, a woman and seven children lived – in Lalor Park in Sydney's west after it was engulfed around 1am today.

       </p>
       <p> 
		But NSW Police allege attempts to rescue the three children, their four siblings and their mother were "frustrated" by the father who tried to block access.
	   </p>

       <p> 
		Eventually, two boys, aged two and four, were taken from the home to Westmead Hospital in a critical condition where they died a short time later.
       </p>
       <p> 
		The body of the third child, a 10-month-old girl, was found after firefighters extinguished the blaze.
